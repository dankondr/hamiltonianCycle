# Hamiltonian Cycle
This program was made in Voronovo HSE at August 2018.<br /><br />
It helps user to verify is there a hamiltonian cycle
in a graph loaded from file which contains adjacency matrix.<br />
Adjacency matrix should be in .txt file and be formatted as stated below.<br /><br />
Adjacency matrix format:
```
Graph1 //graph name
16 //number of vertex
0111100000000000
1000010101000000
1000001010100000
1000001100010000
1000010010001000
